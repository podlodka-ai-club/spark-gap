    world-readable on Linux. We also use an explicit `HEAD:refs/heads/<branch>`
    refspec so no upstream is set and no remote URL is stored in .git/config.

    The worktree is shared with the codex agent, so anything in `.git/hooks/`

    hook, credential helper, fsmonitor, or url-rewrite rule cannot observe
    GIT_TOKEN or redirect the push to an attacker-controlled host:
      * `core.hooksPath=/dev/null` disables `.git/hooks/*` and any hooksPath
        override the agent set in the local config.
      * `credential.helper=` (empty) clears all inherited credential helpers
        so a repo-local helper script never executes with GIT_TOKEN in env.
      * `core.fsmonitor=` disables any fsmonitor program git would otherwise
        spawn for index-touching operations.
      * `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null` and `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM=/dev/null` block
        global/system config entirely, so url.<host>.insteadOf or
        pushInsteadOf rules planted in `~/.gitconfig` (or `/etc/gitconfig`)
        cannot rewrite our auth URL and exfiltrate the askpass token.
      * We also refuse to push if the local config contains any url
